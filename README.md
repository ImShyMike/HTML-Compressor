# HTML Compressor (Say Cheese!)

This website was made to help people in [Say Cheese](https://github.com/24c02/saycheese), a YSWS focues on creating games that fit into a QR code. It can compress HTML files into a dataURI that can then be easily turned into a QR code.

This website also fits into a QR code (compressed using itself!) and can be found [here](https://shymike.is-a.dev/HTML-Compressor) or by scanning this QR code:

## Example

I also included an example Bad Apple website compressed using the compressor available [here](https://shymike.is-a.dev/HTML-Compressor/examples/bad_apple.html):
